# Simple usage of Webhook on GChat
If you have an Enterprise Google account, since a few month, you can send messages via webhook to rooms and group chats.
This is even more useful if you define this small snippet as a library.
You can use it creating a "peronal room" in which the "bot" is able to post the messages.
You can this way use to push short informations to this room instead of flooding emails from your automatic controls.

## My Usage
I have many scheduled script to check my colleagues and collaborators.
A number of those checks run on demand or scheduled.
When the check is completed I get notified in my room by this small bot.
This solves many issues:
* No useless mailbox jam
* Immidiate notification of errors
* Pop up on my mobile (almost a mobile notification without mobile app)

## What's missing
The ability to receive messages and process them. For this a real bot is needed.
By the way, for the moments, it meets a few good requests.

I hope you enjoy this small script.
Feel free to suggest with pull requests.
